## PREDICT CVD Risk Scores

This is an R package featuring functions for generating PREDICT cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk scores.

### Features
-	Estimate 5 year CVD risk in people with and without established CVD
-   Estimate 5 year CVD risk in people who have experienced an acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
-   Estimate 5 year CVD risk in people without established Type-II diabetes
-   Estimate 5 year major bleeding risk in people without established CVD

### Functions

### Usage

#### One-off Calculator
Each function can be used as either a calculator or vectoriser. When used as a one-off calculator, a dataset is not required. This can be handy when checking the risk estimate for 
an individual person or for quickly seeing the effect of changing a single parameter value. 

```r
PostACSRisk(sex="F", age=65, eth=Indian, nzdep=5, smoker=0, diabetes=0,
            af=0, hf=1, acsdays=65, acstype="NSTEMI", bmi=NA, sbp=118,
            tchdl=3.3, hba1c=NA, scr=52, bpl=1, lld=1, athrombi=1)
```
```
[1] 0.4877
```
All parameter values can be numeric or encoded. Values for some parameters such as BMI and HbA1C can be `NA` if the value is unknown. See *values* in R documentation. Binary variables can take `TRUE`/`FALSE` boolean values.
```r
PostACSRisk(sex=0, age=65, eth=43, nzdep=5, smoker=0, diabetes=0,
            af=0, hf=1, acsdays=65, acstype=1, bmi=NA, sbp=118,
            tchdl=3.3, hba1c=NA, scr=52, bpl=T, lld=F, athrombi=1)
```
```
[1] 0.4877
```
Binary parameters can take a variety of input values. For example, the value for `TRUE` can be `T`, `Y`, `Yes`, or `1`, while the value for `FALSE` can be `F`, `N`, `No`, or `0`. Quotations are not required and case sensitivity is ignored.  
```r
NoPriorCVDRisk(sex=F, age=30, eth=M, exsmoker=0, smoker=TRUE, nzdep=3, diabetes=Y,
               af=F, familyhx=1, lld=y, athrombi=yes, bpl=T, sbp=150, tchdl=5)

```
```
[1] 0.0549
```

#### Vectorise Dataset
When a dataset is supplied, a risk score is produced for each row of data. Each argument requires the variable name from the dataset.
This can be handy when risk estimates are required for each row of data, or when datasets require vectorisation.

```r
NoPriorCVDRisk(dat=DATA, sex=sex, age=age, eth=ethnicity, exsmoker=exsmoker, smoker=current_smk, nzdep=nzdep, 
              diabetes=diab_status, af=hx_af, familyhx=familyhx, lld=lld, athrombi=athrombotics, bpl=bpl, 
              sbp=sbp, tchdl=tchdl)
```
```
[1] 0.3327 0.0489 0.0620 0.5441 0.0688 0.1672 0.5054 0.0442 0.0150 0.0387
```
When a dataset is supplied, the function returns a numeric vector of risk scores. Each element of the vector is positioned as per row index. As such, the resulting numeric vector can be 
assigned back to the dataset as a new variable.
```r
DATA$riskscores <- NoPriorCVDRisk(dat=DATA, sex=sex, age=age, eth=ethnicity, exsmoker=exsmoker, smoker=current_smk,
                                  nzdep=nzdep, diabetes=diab_status, af=hx_af, familyhx=familyhx, lld=lld, 
                                  athrombi=athrombotics, bpl=bpl, sbp=sbp, tchdl=tchdl)l)
```

#### Integration with `data.table` and `dplyr`
The suite of functions in this package can be integrated into both `data.table` and `dplyr`. For example, when datasets are extremely large, consider 
using `data.table` along with the `:=` notation. In the example below, a new column called `riskscore` is created.
The `data.table` syntax might seem confusing at first but it offers fast and efficient performance.

```r
library(data.table); setDT(DATA)

DATA[, riskscore := NoPriorCVDRisk(dat=DATA, sex=sex, age=age, eth=ethnicity, exsmoker=exsmoker, smoker=current_smk,
                                  nzdep=nzdep, diabetes=diab_status, af=hx_af, familyhx=familyhx, lld=lld,
                                  athrombi=athrombotics, bpl=bpl, sbp=sbp, tchdl=tchdl)]
```
Users who are more comfortable with `dplyr` will find that the functions works with `mutate`. In the example below, a new column called `riskscore` is created.
```r
library(dplyr)

DATA %>%
  mutate(riskscore = NoPriorCVDRisk(dat=DATA, sex=sex, age=age, eth=ethnicity, exsmoker=exsmoker, smoker=current_smk,
                                    nzdep=nzdep, diabetes=diab_status, af=hx_af, familyhx=familyhx, lld=lld,
                                    athrombi=athrombotics, bpl=bpl, sbp=sbp, tchdl=tchdl))
```

#### Further Arguements
Each function contains 3 dot parameters: `dp`, `allow.age`, and `allow.na`. A function will:

- by default return risk scores to 4 decimal places. The number of decimal places can be changed using the argument `dp`. For example, `dp = 6` will produce risk scores containing 6 decimal places. 
-   by default return risk scores for people between 18 and 110 years of age. Ages 18 - 29 are calculated as 30; and 80 - 110 as 79. However, the risk prediction equations were developed from a cohort of people aged 30 to 74 years. Using the argument `allow.age` will determine whether a function is applied to ages outside of 30 - 74. If `allow.age` is set to `FALSE`, then age values between 30 and 74 must be provided, else `NA` is returned as the risk score. 
-   by default return risk scores where the missing values `NA` is treated as `0`, `No`, or `FALSE`. This applies only to binary variables including smoking status. If `allow.na` is set to `FALSE`, then binary inputs including smoking status must have a value, else `NA` will be returned as the risk score.

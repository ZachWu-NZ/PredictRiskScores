\description{
\code{NoPriorCVDBleedRisk} calculates the 5 year risk of major bleeding (gastrointestinal, intracranial, and other bleeds), for people without cardiovascular disease.
If a dataset of input values are not supplied, then individual values for each coefficient can be specified. If a dataset of input values are supplied, then a risk
estimate is produced for each row of data, resulting in a numeric vector of the same length. A specific format is required for each input value. Encoding may be
required. See arguments.
}
\details{
When the parameter \code{dat} is supplied using a dataset, then parameters take variable names as input. For example, when a dataset is supplied, the parameter \code{age} requires the variable name \code{index_age} as input from the dataset.
When the parameter \code{dat} is not supplied, then parameters take actual values or labels as input. For example, when \code{dat} is not supplied, the parameter \code{age} requires a single numeric value between 30 and 79. This method calculates the 5-year risk estimate for a single individual.
}
\section{Age}{

The risk prediction equations were developed from a cohort of people aged 30 to 79 years. People aged 18-29 years or 80 years and older, are outside the range used
to derive the equation and so risk will be even more of an approximation. To be consistent with equations for primary prevention in this suite of scores, the
function will calculate ages 18-29 as 30; and ages 80-110 as 80.
}

\section{Ethnicity}{

The co-efficients for ethnicity apply only to the following groups: European, Maori, Pacific, Indian, and Asian. Individuals with ethnicity labels (or codes) that fall outside of these categories will not recieve a risk estimate.
To obtain a risk estimate, ensure that the ethnicity parameter is either labelled (not case-sensitive) or encoded as one of the following:
\itemize{
\item NZ European, European, NZEO, Euro, E, 1, 10, 11, 12
\item Maori, NZMaori, NZ Maori, M, 2, 21
\item Pacific, Pacific Islander, PI, P, 3, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37
\item Indian, Fijian Indian, South Asian, IN, I, 43
\item Asian, Other Asian, SE Asian, East Asian, Chinese, ASN, A, 4, 40, 41, 42, 44
}
}

\section{Value}{

Returns either a single bleeding risk estimate or a numeric vector of bleeding risk estimates.

Using the bleeding risk equation developed by Selak et al (2019), I developed a web-based risk calculator that provides clinicians with an individualised estimate of the CVD benefit and bleeding harms of aspirin for their patients without established CVD.

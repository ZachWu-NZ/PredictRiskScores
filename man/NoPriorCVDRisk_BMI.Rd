\description{
\code{NoPriorCVDRisk_BMI} calculates the 5 year absolute risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for people without a history of atherosclerotic CVD.
In this version, BMI is used as a predictor. The outcome of interest is the 5-year risk of a non-fatal or fatal CVD event, including hospitalisation
for coronary heart disease, stroke or other cerebrovascular disease (including transient ischaemic attack), peripheral vascular disease and heart failure,
or cardiovascular death.
}
\details{
When a dataset is supplied, a risk score is produced for each row of data, resulting in a numeric vector of the same length.
Each argument requires the variable name from the dataset \code{dat} that corresponds with the parameter. If the parameter \code{dat} is not supplied, then each argument is assigned an individual's
actual parameter value. \cr

The risk prediction equations were developed from a cohort of people aged 30 to 74 years. Additional analyses indicate that the sex-specific risk equations performed adequately in those aged 75-79 years.
People aged 18-29 years or 80 years and older, are outside the range used to derive the equation, and therefore risk will be even more of an approximation. The function
will calculate ages 18-29 as 30; and ages 80-110 as 79. All other age inputs are invalid and will return \code{NA}. \cr

The co-efficients for ethnicity apply only to the following groups: European, Maori, Pacific, Indian, and (non-Indian) Asian. To obtain a risk estimate, ensure that the
ethnicity input is either labelled or encoded using one of the values listed below (see values). All other inputs are invalid and will return \code{NA}. \cr

The scale for socioeconomic deprivation is derived from the New Zealand Index of Deprivation; a small area-based measure that combines census data relating to income,
home ownership, employment, qualifications, family structure, housing, access to transport and communications. The equations require NZDep to be categorised as quintiles,
with 1 being the least deprived and 5 being the most deprived.

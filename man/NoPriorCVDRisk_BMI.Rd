\description{
\code{NoPriorCVDRisk_BMI} calculates the 5 year risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (hospitalisation for acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, stroke or other cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular death, cardiovascular death),
for people without a history of atherosclerotic CVD. This equation takes into account BMI, If a dataset of input values are not supplied, then individual values for each coefficient can be specified. If a dataset of input values are supplied, then a risk estimate is produced for each row of data, resulting in a numeric vector of the same length.
A specific format is required for each variable input value. Encoding may be required. See arguments.
}
\details{
When the parameter \code{dat} is supplied using a dataset, then parameters take variable names as input. For example, when a dataset is supplied, the parameter \code{age} requires the variable name \code{index_age} as input from the dataset.
When the parameter \code{dat} is not supplied, then parameters take actual values or labels as input. For example, when \code{dat} is not supplied, the parameter \code{age} requires a single numeric value between 30 and 79. This method calculates the 5-year risk estimate for a single individual.
The co-efficients for ethnicity apply only to the following labels (codes): "European" (1), "Maori" (2), "Pacific" (3), "Chinese" (42), "Indian" (43), "Fijian Indian" (43), and "Other Asian" (4). Individuals with ethnicity labels (or codes) that fall outside of these categories will not recieve a risk estimate.
To obtain a risk estimate please ensure that ethnicity is labelled (or encoded) as one of the above categories.

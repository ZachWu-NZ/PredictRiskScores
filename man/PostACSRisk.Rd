\value{
returns either a single 5-year CVD risk estimate, or a numeric vector of risk estimates if \code{dat} is provided.
Input values for each parameter must conform to the following convention:

\item{sex}{label or encode as one of the following:

\itemize{
\item SBP and total:HDL values must be avaliable
}}
\item{bmi, scr,\cr hba1c}{numeric value of calculated BMI, and measured serum creatinine and hba1c.

\item If a value is unknown, then input as \code{NA}
\item Note: a separate coefficient is applied to missing values
}}
\item{acsdays}{numeric value of number of days since last ACS event.
\itemize{
\item If the date of most recent CVD event is unknown, then keep as \code{NA}
\item Note:
}}
\item{acstype}{label or encode as one of the following:
\itemize{
\item STEMI, ST-Elevation, S, 2
\item NSTEMI, Non-STEMI, N, 1

\itemize{
\item \code{dp} numeric value to set decimal place; default is 4
\item \code{allow.age} logical. Whether or not age range is extended outside of 30 - 74; default is TRUE. If set to FALSE, then \code{NA} is returned as risk estimate.
\item \code{allow.na} logical. Whether or not missing values \code{NA}are treated as 0; default is TRUE. Only applies to binary variables and smoking status. If set to FALSE, then \code{NA} is returned as risk estimate.

\description{
\code{PostACSRisk} calculates the 5 year absolute risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for people who have experienced an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event.
It is not intended to be used in the acute phase. The outcome of future CVD is defined as hospitalisation for acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, stroke or
other cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, or cardiovascular death.
}
\details{
When a dataset is supplied, a risk score is produced for each row of data, resulting in a numeric vector of the same length.
Each argument requires the variable name from the dataset \code{dat} that corresponds with the parameter. If the parameter \code{dat} is not supplied, then each argument is assigned an individual's
actual parameter value. \cr

The risk prediction equations were developed from a cohort of people aged 30 to 74 years. Additional analyses indicate that the sex-specific risk equations performed adequately in those aged 75-79 years.
People aged 18-29 years or 80 years and older, are outside the range used to derive the equation, and therefore risk will be even more of an approximation. The function
will calculate ages 18-29 as 30; and ages 80-110 as 79. All other age inputs are invalid and will return \code{NA}. \cr

The co-efficients for ethnicity apply only to the following groups: European, Maori, Pacific, Indian, and (non-Indian) Asian. To obtain a risk estimate, ensure that the
ethnicity input is either labelled or encoded using one of the values listed below (see values). All other inputs are invalid and will return \code{NA}. \cr

The scale for socioeconomic deprivation is derived from the New Zealand Index of Deprivation; a small area-based measure that combines census data relating to income,
home ownership, employment, qualifications, family structure, housing, access to transport and communications. The equations require NZDep to be categorised as quintiles,
with 1 being the least deprived and 5 being the most deprived.

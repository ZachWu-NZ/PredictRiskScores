\usage{
PriorCVDRisk(dat, sex, age, eth, nzdep, smoker, diabetes, af, hf, othervd,
             days, bmi, sbp, tchdl, hba1c, scr, bpl, lld, athromb,...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data.frame or data.table containing input data. Optional. See Details.}

\item{sex}{Sex or gender - input as labels M, Male, F, Female; or encode binary where 1 is male and 0 is female}

\item{age}{Age - input as numeric value between 30 and 79}

\item{eth}{Ethnicity - input as labels "Chinese", "Indian", "Other Asian", "Fijian Indian", "Maori", "Pacific", or "Other"}

\item{nzdep}{Index of socioeconomic deprivation, specifically the New Zealand Deprivation Index - input as numeric quintile value between 1 (least deprived) and 5 (most deprived).}

\item{smoker}{Current smoker - input as labels "Y", "Yes", "Smoker", or encode binary where 1 is "Yes"}

\item{diabetes}{Diabetes status - input as label "Y", "Yes", or encode binary where 1 is "Yes"}

\item{af}{Atrial fibrillation status - input as label "Y", "Yes", or encode binary where 1 is "Yes"}

\item{hf}{Heart failure - input as label "Y", "Yes", or encode binary where 1 is "Yes"}

\item{othervd}{History involving angina, peripheral vascular disease, or non-hospitalised cerebrovascular disease - input as label "Y", "Yes", or encode binary where 1 is "Yes"}

\item{days}{Time since last the most recent CVD event - input as numeric value representing days. If the event was angina or peripheral vascular disease, then enter 1826. If the date of most recent CVD event was not known, then keep as NA.}

\item{bmi}{Body mass index - input as numeric value representing BMI in kg/m^2}

\item{sbp}{Systolic blood pressure - input as numeric value representing measured systolic blood pressure in mmHg}

\item{tchdl}{Total-HDL cholesterol ratio - input as numeric value representing most recent value of total:HDL cholesterol}

\item{hba1c}{HbA1C - input as numeric value representing most recent value of HbA1c in mmol/mol}

\item{scr}{Serum creatinine - input as numeric value representing most recent value of serum creatinine in micromol/L}

\item{bpl}{Receiving at least one blood pressure lowering medication - input as label "Y", "Yes", or encode binary where 1 is "Yes"}

\item{lld}{Receiving lipid lowering medication - input as label "Y", "Yes", or encode binary where 1 is "Yes"}

\item{athromb}{Receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication - input as label "Y", "Yes", or encode binary where 1 is "Yes"}

\item{...}{Set decimal place for integers. Default is 4. Optional.}

\value{
Returns either a single CVD risk estimate or a numeric vector of CVD risk estimates.

\description{
\code{PriorCVDRisk} calculates the 5 year risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (hospitalisation for acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, stroke or other cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular death, cardiovascular death),
for people with a history of atherosclerotic CVD. If a dataset of input values are not supplied, then individual values for each coefficient can be specified. If a dataset of input values are supplied, then a risk estimate is produced for each row of data, resulting in a numeric vector of the same length.
A specific format is required for each variable input value. Encoding may be required. See arguments.
}
\details{
When the parameter \code{dat} is supplied using a dataset, then parameters take variable names as input. For example, when a dataset is supplied, the parameter \code{age} requires the variable name \code{index_age} as input from the dataset.
When the parameter \code{dat} is not supplied, then parameters take actual values or labels as input. For example, when \code{dat} is not supplied, the parameter \code{age} requires a single numeric value between 30 and 79. This method calculates the 5-year risk estimate for a single individual.
